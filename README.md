                                        # Graph-Traversal
Graph Traversal is the process of visiting all the nodes (vertices) in a graph in a specific order to explore the structure or extract information. It is a fundamental operation in many computer science algorithms and applications.


There are two main types of graph traversal:

1.Breadth-First Search (BFS):
    -Visits nodes level by level (i.e., all neighbors first).
    -Uses a queue.
    -Useful for finding the shortest path in unweighted graphs.

2.Depth-First Search (DFS):
    -Explores as deep as possible along each branch before backtracking.
    -Uses a stack (often implemented with recursion).
    -Useful for detecting cycles, connected components, and topological sorting.
